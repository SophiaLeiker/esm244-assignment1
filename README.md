# ESM 244 Assignment 1

This report will explore amphibian abundance data recorded by the Sierra Lakes Inventory Project. From the Environmental Data Initiative repository: “The Sierra Lakes Inventory Project (SLIP) was a research endeavor that ran from 1995-2002 and has supported research and management of Sierra Nevada aquatic ecosystems and their terrestrial interfaces. We described the physical characteristics of and surveyed aquatic communities for >8,000 lentic water bodies in the southern Sierra Nevada, including lakes, ponds, marshes, and meadows.”

The data used comes from: [Sierra Amphibians Dataset](https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/d835832d7fd00d9e4466e44eea87fab3) and metadata, including methods used for data collection can be found here [The Sierra Lakes Inventory Project: Non-Native fish and community composition of lakes and ponds in the Sierra Nevada, California](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=edi.577.2).
